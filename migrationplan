Here's a detailed migration plan specifically for your 20 Java Spring Boot microservices to Azure AKS:

## Spring Boot Specific Pre-Migration Assessment

**Application Analysis**
- Map service dependencies and communication patterns between your 20 microservices
- Identify which services use Spring Cloud components (Config Server, Service Discovery, Circuit Breaker)
- Document database connections and JPA/Hibernate configurations
- Review Spring profiles and environment-specific configurations
- Assess current logging framework (Logback, SLF4J) and log aggregation

**Service Inventory**
- Create a dependency matrix showing inter-service communication
- Identify services that can be migrated independently vs those requiring coordinated deployment
- Document current service discovery mechanisms
- Review API Gateway usage and external endpoints

## Containerization for Spring Boot

**Dockerfile Optimization**
```dockerfile
# Use layered approach for better caching
FROM openjdk:17-jre-slim
VOLUME /tmp
COPY target/*.jar app.jar
ENTRYPOINT ["java","-jar","/app.jar"]
```

**Spring Boot Best Practices**
- Enable Spring Boot's built-in actuator endpoints for health checks
- Configure graceful shutdown with `server.shutdown=graceful`
- Set appropriate JVM heap sizes for container environments
- Use Spring Boot's layered JAR feature for better Docker layer caching
- Configure Spring Boot to use environment variables for configuration

## Configuration Management Strategy

**Spring Cloud Config Migration**
- Migrate from Spring Cloud Config Server to Kubernetes ConfigMaps/Secrets
- Use Spring Cloud Kubernetes for configuration binding
- Implement configuration hot-reload using Spring Cloud Bus or restart policies

**Application Properties**
```yaml
# application.yml for Kubernetes
spring:
  application:
    name: ${SERVICE_NAME}
  datasource:
    url: ${DB_URL}
    username: ${DB_USERNAME}
    password: ${DB_PASSWORD}
management:
  endpoints:
    web:
      exposure:
        include: health,info,metrics,prometheus
  endpoint:
    health:
      show-details: always
```

## Service Discovery Migration

**From Eureka to Kubernetes Native**
- Replace Eureka Client with Spring Cloud Kubernetes Discovery
- Use Kubernetes Services for service-to-service communication
- Implement service mesh (Istio) if complex routing is needed
- Configure DNS-based service discovery

**Spring Cloud Kubernetes Configuration**
```yaml
spring:
  cloud:
    kubernetes:
      discovery:
        enabled: true
      config:
        enabled: true
        sources:
          - name: ${spring.application.name}
            namespace: ${NAMESPACE}
```

## Database and Persistence Migration

**Connection Management**
- Configure connection pooling (HikariCP) for container environments
- Set appropriate connection pool sizes for Kubernetes resource limits
- Use Azure Database for PostgreSQL/MySQL with connection strings in secrets
- Implement database migration tools (Flyway/Liquibase) as init containers

**JPA Configuration**
```yaml
spring:
  jpa:
    hibernate:
      ddl-auto: validate
    show-sql: false
    properties:
      hibernate:
        dialect: org.hibernate.dialect.PostgreSQLDialect
        jdbc:
          lob:
            non_contextual_creation: true
```

## Kubernetes Manifests for Spring Boot

**Deployment Template**
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: service-name
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: service-name
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: service-name
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: service-name
        image: your-registry/service-name:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8080
        env:
        - name: SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE
          value: "kubernetes"
        - name: DB_URL
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: db-secret
              key: url
        livenessProbe:
          httpGet:
            path: /actuator/health/liveness
            port: 8080
          initialDelaySeconds: 30
          periodSeconds: 10
        readinessProbe:
          httpGet:
            path: /actuator/health/readiness
            port: 8080
          initialDelaySeconds: 5
          periodSeconds: 5
        resources:
          requests:
            memory: "512Mi"
            cpu: "250m"
          limits:
            memory: "1Gi"
            cpu: "500m"
```

public interface UserServiceClient {
    @GetMapping("/users/{id}")
    User getUserById(@PathVariable Long id);
}
```
